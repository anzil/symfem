## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs
If you find a bug in Symfem, please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mscroggs/symfem/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).

### Suggesting enhancements
If you want to suggest a new feature or an improvement of a current feature, you can submit this
on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mscroggs/symfem/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=).

### Submitting a pull request
If you want to directly submit code to Symfem, you can do this by forking the Symfem repo, then submitting a pull request.
If you want to contribute, but are unsure where to start, have a look at the
[issues labelled "good first issue"](https://github.com/mscroggs/symfem/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

On opening a pull request, unit tests and flake8 style checks will run. You can click on these in the pull request
to see where (if anywhere) there are errors in your code.

### Code of conduct
We expect all our contributors to follow [the Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any unacceptable
behaviour can be reported to Matthew (symfem@mscroggs.co.uk).
